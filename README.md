snake
=====

On my way home from work the commuter trains stood still because of an
accident. After I had waited for about an hour on the station playing Snake on
Facebook Messager I decided to roll my own version of the game. Because the
Facebook Messager one is really buggy (I really wish I had my old Nokia 3310
right now).

## ~~My objective~~

   * ~~Make a working snake before my laptop runs out of battery~~
   * Make it less buggy ~~in that time.~~
   
## **MISSION FAILED**

The trains started to move again after about 30 minutes.

However, at the time of writing (5 days later), it should be fully playable.

## Requirements

   * Python 3.6
     * For Python 3.5 support, f-strings can be changed into `str.format`
       instead
     * For Python 3.x support, remove any f-strings and type annotations.
     
## Run

    $ git clone https://github.com/jocke-l/snake.git
    $ cd snake/
    $ python3 -m snake
